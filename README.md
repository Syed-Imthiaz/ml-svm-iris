# 🌸 SVM Classifier on Iris Dataset

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier using Scikit-learn to classify species in the **Iris flower dataset**.

---

## 🔍 About the Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of **150 samples** of iris flowers from three different species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) with 4 features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## 🧠 ML Model: SVM (Support Vector Machine)

This project:
- Uses a **linear kernel** SVM for multi-class classification
- Applies **feature scaling** with `StandardScaler`
- Evaluates model performance using a **confusion matrix** and **classification report**

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
